## [Unreleased]

### ‚ú® New Features

- **Smart Locking System for Concurrency Control**
  - **Problem**: Multiple validation runs (different terminals, worktrees) could conflict with shared resources like ports or databases
  - **Solution**: Configurable locking system with wait-for-completion mode
  - **Impact**: Prevents duplicate validation runs and resource conflicts
  - **Key capabilities**:
    - Enabled by default - only one validation runs at a time
    - Wait mode (default): New runs wait for existing validation to complete
    - Project-scoped locking: Share locks across worktrees when using fixed ports/databases
    - Directory-scoped locking (default): Each directory has its own lock for parallel worktrees
    - Auto-detection of project ID from git remote or package.json
    - CLI flags: `--no-lock`, `--no-wait`, `--wait-timeout <seconds>`
  - **Configuration**:
    ```yaml
    locking:
      enabled: true  # Default: true
      concurrencyScope: directory  # "directory" (default) or "project"
      projectId: my-app  # Optional: auto-detected
    ```
  - **Use cases**:
    - Directory scope: No shared resources, parallel worktrees OK
    - Project scope: Tests use fixed ports (3000, 8080) or shared databases
    - Disable: CI environments with isolated containers
  - See [Locking Configuration Guide](docs/locking-configuration.md) for details

## [0.12.1] - 2025-10-24

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- **CRITICAL: Fixed npm publish process** - v0.12.0 publishing issue
  - **Problem**: Packages published with `npm publish` didn't resolve `workspace:*` dependencies, making them uninstallable
  - **Solution**: Re-published using `pnpm publish -r` which correctly resolves workspace dependencies to versioned dependencies
  - **Impact**: Packages are now installable via `npm install @vibe-validate/cli@0.12.1`
  - **v0.12.0 deprecated**: Do not use v0.12.0 - it has broken dependencies

## [0.12.0] - 2025-10-23 [DEPRECATED - Use 0.12.1]

### üö® BREAKING CHANGES

- **State File Deprecated - Git Notes-Based Caching**
  - **Problem**: `.vibe-validate-state.yaml` file only cached one tree hash, limiting cache effectiveness
  - **Solution**: Git notes provide content-based caching across branches
  - **Impact**: Run `vibe-validate doctor` after upgrade to detect and remove deprecated files
  - **Migration**: Delete `.vibe-validate-state.yaml` and remove from `.gitignore`
  - Better cache hits across branch switches, reverts, and multiple branches
  - No more cache misses from branch changes when code is identical

- **Formatters Package Replaced by Extractors Package**
  - **Problem**: Old `@vibe-validate/formatters` package had unclear naming and limited extraction capabilities
  - **Solution**: New `@vibe-validate/extractors` package with improved error parsing and LLM optimization
  - **Impact**: Internal architecture change - no user action required (automatic with upgrade)
  - **Benefits**:
    - Smarter extraction (only runs on failed tests)
    - Better test framework support (Vitest, Jest, ESLint, TypeScript)
    - Quality metrics for contributors
    - 90% smaller output storage

### ‚ú® New Features

- **Validation History Tracking** (Issue #23)
  - `vibe-validate history list` - View validation timeline across all tree hashes
  - `vibe-validate history show <hash>` - Inspect specific validation results
  - `vibe-validate history prune` - Cleanup old history (by age or all)
  - `vibe-validate history health` - Check git notes storage health
  - Multi-run support per tree hash (tracks every validation run)
  - Worktree stability checks (before/after validation)
  - Output truncation (10KB max per step)

- **Enhanced `vibe-validate state` Command**
  - Now reads from git notes instead of state file
  - Same command, same output format, better caching
  - Displays most recent validation for current tree hash
  - Compatible YAML output format maintained

- **Pre-commit Secret Scanning** (Issue #24)
  - **Problem**: Developers accidentally commit API keys, tokens, and passwords to git
  - **Solution**: Configurable pre-commit secret scanning blocks commits containing secrets
  - **Impact**: Prevents credential leaks before they enter git history
  - Tool-agnostic design via `scanCommand` configuration
  - Gitleaks recommended (fast, free, 160+ secret types)
  - Advisory doctor check ensures scanner is installed
  - Comprehensive false positive management (baseline, .gitleaksignore, inline comments)
  - All config templates include secret scanning by default
  - Pre-commit only (GitHub already scans repos after push)

- **Developer Feedback Mode** (`developerFeedback: true`)
  - **Problem**: Error extraction ran on all tests and exposed quality metrics to end users
  - **Solution**: Smart extraction that only runs when needed and reports quality when helpful
  - **How it works**:
    - Extractors only run on failed tests (skip passing tests entirely)
    - Extraction quality metrics only included when `developerFeedback: true`
    - Alert "vibe-validate improvement opportunity" when extraction quality < 50%
  - **Impact**:
    - Faster validation (skip ~10ms extraction per passing test)
    - Cleaner YAML output for end users (no extraction noise)
    - Reduced LLM context window usage (only actionable failures)
    - Clear separation: end-user mode vs contributor mode
  - **For contributors**: Set `developerFeedback: true` to help improve vibe-validate extractors

- **YAML Output Separator for LLM-Friendly Parsing** (RFC 4627 compliant)
  - **Problem**: When using `--yaml` flag, progress messages on stderr mix with YAML on stdout in terminal view
  - **Solution**: Added standard `---` separator before YAML output to mark boundary
  - **Impact**:
    - Clear visual separation between progress and data
    - Easy extraction: `sed -n '/^---$/,$p'` gets pure YAML
    - Standards-compliant (YAML document separator)
    - LLMs can deterministically parse output
  - **Recommendation**: Use `pnpm validate --yaml` for LLM workflows (see CLAUDE.md)

- **3 New Doctor Health Checks** (15 total checks now):
  - Detects deprecated `.vibe-validate-state.yaml` file
  - Warns if state file still in `.gitignore`
  - Checks validation history health (git notes)
  - Suggests cleanup when needed

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- **CRITICAL: Fixed Git Tree Hash Calculation** (Improved cache reliability and security)
  - **Problem**: Unstaged file changes weren't included in tree hash, causing false cache hits
  - **Solution**: Removed `--intent-to-add` flag that prevented content from being staged
  - **Impact**: Cache now correctly invalidates when files change, preventing stale validation results

- **SECURITY: Fixed .gitignore Handling in Tree Hash**
  - **Problem**: `--force` flag included ignored files (secrets, credentials) in tree hash
  - **Solution**: Removed `--force` flag to respect .gitignore rules
  - **Impact**: Secrets no longer checksummed, cache sharing works reliably across developers

- **Fixed Git Tree Hash Error Handling**
  - Git stderr now properly captured (was being ignored)
  - Non-git repositories now handled gracefully
  - Proper fallback to timestamp-based hash
  - `vibe-validate state` exits 0 in non-git repos

- **CRITICAL: Fixed Pre-Commit Caching Bug** (v0.11.0 regression)
  - **Problem**: Pre-commit hook bypassed git tree hash caching, always running full validation (30+ seconds) even when code unchanged
  - **Root Cause**: `pre-commit.ts` called `runValidation()` directly instead of reusing `validate.ts` workflow with caching logic
  - **Solution**: Extracted shared `validate-workflow.ts` used by both commands - true code reuse with all caching/history features
  - **Impact**:
    - Pre-commit now gets instant cache hits (same as `validate` command)
    - 30+ seconds reduced to <100ms when validation already passed
    - All future validate improvements automatically apply to pre-commit
    - Reduced code duplication (validate.ts: 276 ‚Üí 60 lines)
  - **If you experienced slow pre-commit in v0.11.0, this is now fixed**

### ‚ö° Performance Improvements

- **90% Reduction in Git Notes Storage Size**
  - **Problem**: Failed validation output stored raw (100+ lines of environment variables, verbose test output)
  - **Solution**: Extract actionable failures before storing (5-10 lines of clean, structured errors)
  - **Impact**:
    - Git notes operations are faster
    - `vibe-validate state` shows clean, LLM-friendly errors immediately
    - Less disk space used for validation history
    - Critical metadata (pass/fail, recovery commands) always available even if output truncated

- **Truncation-Safe YAML Output**
  - **Problem**: If YAML output was truncated, critical recovery information could be lost
  - **Solution**: Verbose fields (error output) placed at end of YAML structure
  - **Impact**: YAML remains parseable and actionable even if truncated by logs or display tools

### üìù Documentation

- **LLM-Optimized Workflow Guide** (CLAUDE.md)
  - New section explaining best practices for AI assistants
  - `validate --yaml` recommended over two-step `validate` + `state`
  - Examples of parsing YAML from mixed stderr/stdout
  - Benefits: context-efficient, machine-parseable, human-readable progress

  - CLAUDE.md: Prominent upgrade workflow section
  - README.md: Added doctor to Quick Start (4 steps)
  - Pattern: `upgrade ‚Üí doctor ‚Üí fix ‚Üí verify ‚Üí commit`

- **Updated Agent Integration Guide**
  - All examples use `vibe-validate state` command
  - Python and Node.js examples updated
  - Added note: "Validation state stored in git notes (not files)"

- **Auto-Synced CLI Reference**
  - Updated with new `history` commands
  - Perfect sync with `--help --verbose` output

  - Auto-detects PR from current branch or accepts PR number
  - Extracts vibe-validate state files from failed CI runs
  - Provides actionable recovery commands
  - Supports fail-fast mode and configurable timeout
  - Human-friendly live display OR structured YAML output

- **YAML-Only Output Standardization** (BREAKING CHANGE)
  - Removed confusing `--format` and `--json` options from all commands
  - Single `--yaml` flag across all commands for structured output
  - Clear semantics: `--yaml` means exactly what it says
  - Affected commands: `doctor`, `sync-check`, `cleanup`, `watch-pr`

- **Windows Compatibility** (Issue #4)
  - Cross-platform shell execution (`shell: true`)
  - Platform-specific process termination (taskkill on Windows, signals on Unix)
  - Windows CI testing (Ubuntu + macOS + Windows √ó Node 20 + 22 + 24)
  - Fixed ESLint glob patterns for Windows
  - Comprehensive line ending normalization

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- **Fixed Incomplete Schema** (discovered during strict validation implementation)
  - Added missing `validation.failFast` field to schema (was used by code but not in schema)
  - Added missing `description` field to ValidationStepSchema (for documenting what steps do)
  - These fields were being used in configs but silently ignored - now properly validated
  - Updated all config templates to include these fields with helpful comments

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility Fixes**
  - Fixed stdout/stderr capture on Windows (disabled detached mode)
  - Fixed line ending differences (CRLF vs LF) across all file operations
  - Fixed platform-specific test failures (permission bits, signals)
  - Added `.gitattributes` and `.editorconfig` for consistent line endings

### üö® BREAKING CHANGES

- **Output Flag Standardization**
  - Old: `doctor --json`, `sync-check --format yaml`, `cleanup --format json`
  - New: All commands use `--yaml` for structured output
  - Migration: Replace `--json` or `--format` with `--yaml` in scripts/workflows

- **Removed TypeScript Preset System**
  - `preset:` property no longer supported in configs
  - Migration: Copy YAML templates from `config-templates/` directory instead
  - See [Config Templates Guide](./config-templates/README.md) for migration instructions

- **Strict Schema Validation Enabled**
  - Unknown properties in configs now cause validation errors (previously ignored silently)
  - Example: `output.format` field no longer exists - remove it from your config
  - Run `vibe-validate doctor` to check your config for issues
  - Benefits: Catches typos, prevents configuration drift

### ‚ú® Features

- **Config Templates Replace Presets**
  - Four YAML templates available in `config-templates/` directory
  - Templates are transparent (everything visible, no hidden defaults)
  - Anyone can contribute templates (no TypeScript knowledge needed)
  - Browse on GitHub: https://github.com/jdutton/vibe-validate/tree/main/config-templates
  - Copy template ‚Üí customize ‚Üí done

- **Strict Validation Prevents Configuration Drift**
  - Unknown properties immediately rejected with clear error messages
  - Catches removed/renamed fields (like `output.format`)
  - Catches typos in configuration field names
  - Fail fast with helpful errors instead of silent failures

### üìù Documentation

- **New**: [Config Templates Guide](./config-templates/README.md)

  - getting-started.md
  - configuration-reference.md
  - agent-integration-guide.md
  - error-extractors-guide.md

### üóëÔ∏è Removed

- **Removed unused configuration fields** (YAGNI principle - "You Aren't Gonna Need It"):
  - `preset:` field - Use config templates from `config-templates/` directory instead
  - `extends:` field - Zero usage detected, templates are simpler
  - `output:` section - Was never implemented

- **Impact**: Cleaner, more focused configuration schema with only actively-used features

### üéØ Migration Guide

**Before (v0.10.x and earlier):**
```yaml
preset: typescript-nodejs
git:
  mainBranch: develop
```

**After (v0.11.0+):**
```bash
# Copy template
curl -o vibe-validate.config.yaml \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdutton/vibe-validate/main/config-templates/typescript-nodejs.yaml

# Edit to customize (e.g., change mainBranch to 'develop')
```

**Strict validation fix:**
```yaml
# Remove unknown properties
output:
  format: auto  # ‚ùå Remove this - field doesn't exist
```

Run `vibe-validate doctor` to check your config for issues.

### üìä Impact

- **Transparent configs**: Everything visible in YAML (no hidden defaults)
- **Better errors**: Unknown properties caught immediately with helpful guidance
