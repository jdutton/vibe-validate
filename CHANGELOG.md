### üêõ Bug Fixes

- **CRITICAL: Fix tree hash consistency between validate and validate --check** (Issue #8)
  - Replaced non-deterministic `getWorkingTreeHash()` (using `git stash create` with timestamps) with deterministic `getGitTreeHash()` (using `git write-tree`, content-based only)
  - **CRITICAL FIX**: Use temporary GIT_INDEX_FILE to prevent corrupting git index during pre-commit hooks
  - Added `@vibe-validate/git` as dependency to `@vibe-validate/core` package
  - Ensures `validate` and `validate --check` calculate identical tree hashes for unchanged working tree
  - Fixes broken caching mechanism that defeated the 312x speedup feature
  - `--check` flag now accurately detects when validation is needed vs already passed
  - Added TDD test to verify deterministic hash calculation (Issue #8)

  - Timing labels: Changed "First run/Cached run" to "When code changes/When code unchanged"
  - Try It Out section: Focused on 3 key prerequisites (Node.js, Git, package manager) instead of listing all doctor checks
  - Added note that `doctor` provides additional setup guidance beyond prerequisites
  - Better positioning for AI agents evaluating project suitability

- **Added CHANGELOG.md update requirement to CLAUDE.md**
  - Documented mandatory CHANGELOG update before any release
  - Added example CHANGELOG entry format with Issue #8 as demonstration

### üîß Changed

  - Removed `OutputFormatSchema` and `OutputFormat` type from config package
  - State files (`.vibe-validate-state.yaml`) are now written in YAML format for both human and machine readability
  - JSON is valid YAML, so existing JSON state files will still be parsed correctly
  - Removed implicit format auto-detection - explicit and simple is better
  - Updated all presets, init command, and config command to remove format references
  - All 374 tests passing

## [0.9.8] - 2025-10-18

   - Parallel + cached validation (speed up iteration)
   - Agent-optimized error output (minimize context window usage)
   - Branch sync enforcement (keep branches current with main)

2. **Built for Claude Code** - Primarily tested with Anthropic's AI coding assistant

### ‚ú® Features

- **312x faster cached validation** (288ms vs 90s when code unchanged)
- **Git tree hash caching** - Content-based, deterministic
- **Parallel phase execution** - Run independent checks simultaneously
- **Agent-optimized output** - Auto-detects Claude Code, Cursor, Aider, Continue
- **Branch sync enforcement** - Pre-commit hook ensures branches stay current
- **GitHub Actions generator** - CI/CD workflow auto-generated from config
- **Configuration diagnostics** - `doctor` command checks setup (7 health checks)
