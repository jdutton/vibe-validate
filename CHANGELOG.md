## [Unreleased]

### ‚ú® New Features

- **Pre-commit Secret Scanning** (Issue #24)
  - **Problem**: Developers accidentally commit API keys, tokens, and passwords to git
  - **Solution**: Configurable pre-commit secret scanning blocks commits containing secrets
  - **Impact**: Prevents credential leaks before they enter git history
  - Tool-agnostic design via `scanCommand` configuration
  - Gitleaks recommended (fast, free, 160+ secret types)
  - Advisory doctor check ensures scanner is installed
  - Comprehensive false positive management (baseline, .gitleaksignore, inline comments)
  - All config templates include secret scanning by default
  - Pre-commit only (GitHub already scans repos after push)

## [0.11.0] - 2025-10-20

### ‚ú® New Features

- **Real-time CI Monitoring with `watch-pr` Command** (Issue #21)
  - Monitor GitHub Actions PR checks in real-time
  - Auto-detects PR from current branch or accepts PR number
  - Extracts vibe-validate state files from failed CI runs
  - Provides actionable recovery commands
  - Supports fail-fast mode and configurable timeout
  - Human-friendly live display OR structured YAML output

- **YAML-Only Output Standardization** (BREAKING CHANGE)
  - Removed confusing `--format` and `--json` options from all commands
  - Single `--yaml` flag across all commands for structured output
  - Clear semantics: `--yaml` means exactly what it says
  - Affected commands: `doctor`, `sync-check`, `cleanup`, `watch-pr`

- **Windows Compatibility** (Issue #4)
  - Cross-platform shell execution (`shell: true`)
  - Platform-specific process termination (taskkill on Windows, signals on Unix)
  - Windows CI testing (Ubuntu + macOS + Windows √ó Node 20 + 22 + 24)
  - Fixed ESLint glob patterns for Windows
  - Comprehensive line ending normalization

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- **Fixed Incomplete Schema** (discovered during strict validation implementation)
  - Added missing `validation.failFast` field to schema (was used by code but not in schema)
  - Added missing `description` field to ValidationStepSchema (for documenting what steps do)
  - These fields were being used in configs but silently ignored - now properly validated
  - Updated all config templates to include these fields with helpful comments

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility Fixes**
  - Fixed stdout/stderr capture on Windows (disabled detached mode)
  - Fixed line ending differences (CRLF vs LF) across all file operations
  - Fixed platform-specific test failures (permission bits, signals)
  - Added `.gitattributes` and `.editorconfig` for consistent line endings

### üö® BREAKING CHANGES

- **Output Flag Standardization**
  - Old: `doctor --json`, `sync-check --format yaml`, `cleanup --format json`
  - New: All commands use `--yaml` for structured output
  - Migration: Replace `--json` or `--format` with `--yaml` in scripts/workflows

- **Removed TypeScript Preset System**
  - `preset:` property no longer supported in configs
  - Migration: Copy YAML templates from `config-templates/` directory instead
  - See [Config Templates Guide](./config-templates/README.md) for migration instructions

- **Strict Schema Validation Enabled**
  - Unknown properties in configs now cause validation errors (previously ignored silently)
  - Example: `output.format` field no longer exists - remove it from your config
  - Run `vibe-validate doctor` to check your config for issues
  - Benefits: Catches typos, prevents configuration drift

### ‚ú® Features

- **Config Templates Replace Presets**
  - Four YAML templates available in `config-templates/` directory
  - Templates are transparent (everything visible, no hidden defaults)
  - Anyone can contribute templates (no TypeScript knowledge needed)
  - Browse on GitHub: https://github.com/jdutton/vibe-validate/tree/main/config-templates
  - Copy template ‚Üí customize ‚Üí done

- **Strict Validation Prevents Configuration Drift**
  - Unknown properties immediately rejected with clear error messages
  - Catches removed/renamed fields (like `output.format`)
  - Catches typos in configuration field names
  - Fail fast with helpful errors instead of silent failures

### üìù Documentation

- **New**: [Config Templates Guide](./config-templates/README.md)
  - Explains how to use YAML templates
  - Migration guide from old `preset:` system
  - Best practices for customizing templates
  - Examples for all project types

- **Updated**: All documentation now references config templates instead of presets
  - getting-started.md
  - configuration-reference.md
  - agent-integration-guide.md
  - error-formatters-guide.md

### üóëÔ∏è Removed

- **Removed unused configuration fields** (YAGNI principle - "You Aren't Gonna Need It"):
  - `preset:` field - Use config templates from `config-templates/` directory instead
  - `extends:` field - Zero usage detected, templates are simpler
  - `output:` section - Was never implemented

- **Impact**: Cleaner, more focused configuration schema with only actively-used features

### üéØ Migration Guide

**Before (v0.10.x and earlier):**
```yaml
preset: typescript-nodejs
git:
  mainBranch: develop
```

**After (v0.11.0+):**
```bash
# Copy template
curl -o vibe-validate.config.yaml \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdutton/vibe-validate/main/config-templates/typescript-nodejs.yaml

# Edit to customize (e.g., change mainBranch to 'develop')
```

**Strict validation fix:**
```yaml
# Remove unknown properties
output:
  format: auto  # ‚ùå Remove this - field doesn't exist
```

Run `vibe-validate doctor` to check your config for issues.

### üìä Impact

- **Transparent configs**: Everything visible in YAML (no hidden defaults)
- **Better errors**: Unknown properties caught immediately with helpful guidance
- **Easier contributions**: Anyone can submit template PRs (no TypeScript knowledge needed)
- **Faster onboarding**: Copy template ‚Üí customize ‚Üí done

  - Removed `OutputFormatSchema` and `OutputFormat` type from config package
  - State files (`.vibe-validate-state.yaml`) are now written in YAML format for both human and machine readability
  - JSON is valid YAML, so existing JSON state files will still be parsed correctly
  - Removed implicit format auto-detection - explicit and simple is better
