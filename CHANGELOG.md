## [Unreleased]

## [0.10.1] - 2025-10-19

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- **CRITICAL: Fixed broken `init` command** (Issue #12)
  - **Problem**: `vibe-validate init` was creating `.ts` config files that couldn't be loaded, breaking the initialization workflow for new users in v0.10.0
  - **Solution**: Now correctly generates `vibe-validate.config.yaml` files
  - **Impact**: New users can now successfully initialize and use vibe-validate

- **Fixed IDE autocomplete for YAML configs**
  - Corrected JSON Schema URL in generated configs
  - IDEs (VS Code, WebStorm, etc.) now properly provide autocomplete and validation

### üìù Documentation

- Updated all examples to use YAML configuration format
- Added migration guide for users with legacy `.mjs` configs: `npx vibe-validate init --migrate`
- Clarified that YAML is the only supported format (`.ts`, `.js`, `.json` are not supported)

## [0.10.0] - 2025-10-19

### üéâ Major Features

  - Legacy `.mjs` support with deprecation warnings
  - Migration command: `vibe-validate init --migrate` to convert .mjs ‚Üí YAML
  - Better IDE support, more readable, industry-standard format

  - `init --setup-workflow`: Create GitHub Actions workflow only
  - `init --fix-gitignore`: Add state file to .gitignore only
  - `init --migrate`: Convert .mjs config to YAML format

  - All operations are idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
  - 50+ comprehensive tests for setup operations

- **Enhanced Doctor Diagnostics** (Issue #6)
  - Version check with upgrade guidance
  - .gitignore validation for state file
  - Config format migration warnings with actionable steps

  - New `SetupCheck` interface for standardized operations
  - Reusable check/preview/fix pattern
  - Idempotent operations with preview mode
  - Comprehensive test coverage (50 tests)

  - No more `@pnpm/types` warnings during npm operations

- **Reduced Duplicate .mjs Warnings in Doctor Command**
  - Refactored `runDoctor()` to load config once
  - Reduced duplicate deprecation warnings from 7 to 1
  - Updated 7 function signatures to accept config parameter
  - Better performance and cleaner output

### üîß Changed

- **Duration Format Improvement**
  - Changed validation state file from milliseconds to seconds
  - Field renamed: `duration` ‚Üí `durationSecs` (camelCase)
  - More human-readable output (e.g., `1.1` instead of `1100`)

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Refactoring

- **Git Detection (DRY)** (Issue #6)
  - Extracted shared `git-detection.ts` module
  - Removed 82 lines of duplication from `init.ts`
  - 11 comprehensive tests for git detection
  - Reusable across commands

### üìù Documentation

- **CLI Reference Updates** (Issue #6)
  - Complete `init` command documentation
  - Doctor command usage guide
  - All focused modes with examples
  - Migration workflow guide

### ‚úÖ Testing

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
  - All features written with TDD approach
  - 460/460 tests passing (100% pass rate)
  - 17 new test files added
  - Coverage maintained at 80%+

### üéØ Migration Demonstration

- **Dogfooding**: This project itself migrated from .mjs to YAML
  - Demonstrates the `init --migrate` workflow
  - Doctor now shows 15/15 checks passing (was 14/15)
  - No deprecation warnings

## [0.9.11] - 2025-10-18

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- **CRITICAL: Fix tree hash consistency between validate and validate --check** (Issue #8)
  - Replaced non-deterministic `getWorkingTreeHash()` (using `git stash create` with timestamps) with deterministic `getGitTreeHash()` (using `git write-tree`, content-based only)
  - **CRITICAL FIX**: Use temporary GIT_INDEX_FILE to prevent corrupting git index during pre-commit hooks
  - Added `@vibe-validate/git` as dependency to `@vibe-validate/core` package
  - Ensures `validate` and `validate --check` calculate identical tree hashes for unchanged working tree
  - Fixes broken caching mechanism that defeated the 312x speedup feature
  - `--check` flag now accurately detects when validation is needed vs already passed
  - Added TDD test to verify deterministic hash calculation (Issue #8)
  - Removed deprecated non-deterministic `getWorkingTreeHash()` function from core package
  - Pre-commit hook now works correctly without corrupting staged files

### üìù Documentation

- **Improved README clarity** (Issue #1)
  - Quick Start section: Clarified that `validate` is an ongoing command (run before every commit), not one-time
  - Timing labels: Changed "First run/Cached run" to "When code changes/When code unchanged"
  - Try It Out section: Focused on 3 key prerequisites (Node.js, Git, package manager) instead of listing all doctor checks
  - Added note that `doctor` provides additional setup guidance beyond prerequisites
  - Better positioning for AI agents evaluating project suitability

- **Added CHANGELOG.md update requirement to CLAUDE.md**
  - Documented mandatory CHANGELOG update before any release
  - Added example CHANGELOG entry format with Issue #8 as demonstration

### üîß Changed

- **Removed `config.output.format` field** - State files are now always written as YAML (not JSON)
  - Removed `OutputFormatSchema` and `OutputFormat` type from config package
  - State files (`.vibe-validate-state.yaml`) are now written in YAML format for both human and machine readability
  - JSON is valid YAML, so existing JSON state files will still be parsed correctly
  - Removed implicit format auto-detection - explicit and simple is better
  - Updated all presets, init command, and config command to remove format references
  - All 374 tests passing

## [0.9.8] - 2025-10-18

### üéâ Initial Public Release

**vibe-validate** is a git-aware validation orchestration tool built specifically for **agentic coding workflows** with AI assistants like [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code).

### Core Design Goals (Why This Exists)

1. **Enforce SDLC best practices with AI agents**
   - Validate before pushing (prevent broken PRs)
   - Synchronize PR/local validation (guarantee CI passes)
   - Parallel + cached validation (speed up iteration)
   - Agent-optimized error output (minimize context window usage)
   - Branch sync enforcement (keep branches current with main)

2. **Built for Claude Code** - Primarily tested with Anthropic's AI coding assistant

### ‚ú® Features

- **312x faster cached validation** (288ms vs 90s when code unchanged)
- **Git tree hash caching** - Content-based, deterministic
- **Parallel phase execution** - Run independent checks simultaneously
- **Agent-optimized output** - Auto-detects Claude Code, Cursor, Aider, Continue
- **Branch sync enforcement** - Pre-commit hook ensures branches stay current
- **GitHub Actions generator** - CI/CD workflow auto-generated from config
- **Configuration diagnostics** - `doctor` command checks setup (7 health checks)

### üì¶ Packages

- **@vibe-validate/cli** - Command-line interface
- **@vibe-validate/core** - Validation orchestration engine
- **@vibe-validate/git** - Git workflow utilities
- **@vibe-validate/formatters** - Error parsing & LLM optimization

- Speedup: 312x

### üìä Test Coverage

- **371 tests** passing (100% pass rate)
- **75.76% coverage**
- **Self-hosting** - vibe-validate validates itself

### üéØ Primary Use Case

**Agentic coding with Claude Code**:
- Prevent broken PRs before they reach CI
- Guarantee local/CI validation sync
- Speed up debugging with filtered test output
- Enforce branch synchronization with main
- Minimize AI context window usage

### ü§ñ AI Assistant Support
